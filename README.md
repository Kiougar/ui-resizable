# ui-resizable
AngularJS UI Resizable directive - A mini port of the [JQueryUI Resizable](http://jqueryui.com/resizable/) plugin.

I implemented: 
- the `e`,`s`,`se` handles
- the `containment` option
- the `max/min width/height` options
- some new options that are used to customize the CSS classes added by the directive

There is still room for new features so feel free to comment/suggest or even throw a PR!
